## About Search+ ##

Search+ is a notepad++ plugin that lets you search a file for multiple keywords in a single shot. You can specify a list of keywords to search for in the current file, and filter out lines that match any of the keywords in this list. It was developed mainly for analyzing large log files where you are interested in more than one keyword and the order in which they appear.

  * Matching lines are listed with their line numbers in a separate panel in the plugin window
  * Double clicking a matched line in this panel will take you to the corresponding line in the original document
  * Options to copy the filtered lines to clipboard and highlight matches in the original file
  * Supports case sensitive search, whole word matchng and regular expressions. Regexp is enabled by default
